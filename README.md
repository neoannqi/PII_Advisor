# BT3101 Capstone Project: Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Advisor

### Background:

Govtechâ€™s MyCareersFuture team is facing challenges understanding unstructured data in resumes on Singapore's national job portal (https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/). They wish to improve how personally identifiable information (PII) in resumes are handled, which would minimise the costs of any data leakage or security breach.

In collaboration with NUS School of Computing (Business Analytics), Govtech has developed a PII advisor which alerts administrators about, flags out, and masks PIIs in resumes and enable classification of documents according to their level of confidentiality.

### Technical Documentation:

The main directory is split into 3 key components:
- [Software Engineering](./Software_Engineering)
- [Data Science](./data_science)
- [Dashboard](./Dashboard)

#### [Software Engineering](./Software_Engineering)

The software directory is the most important, where it houses productionised data science codes, together with docker configurations that can be launched to create an API that can receive resume files and return parsed results. 

##### Key Commands

###### Building the Image

Run the following to build the Docker image:

```sh
make build;
```

###### Starting a complete environment

Run the following to run the image with a complete expected setup:

```sh
make start;
```

To run a sample:

```sh
curl -vv localhost:5000/0011.doc;
```

#### [Data Science](./data_science)

The data science folder stores the data science codes and unit tests. It is mainly used for research and development on methods to improve parsing, and any machine learning models that were tested.

For our model, we used a pretrained model from [Dataturks](https://dataturks.com/projects/abhishek.narayanan/Entity%20Recognition%20in%20Resumes) as our baseline. To create an improved model that can work better with Singaporean resumes, we have trained it with local resumes.

#### [Dashboard](./Dashboard)

The dashboard folder contains a prototype of what could be visualised after analysing the results of the PII advisor.

Note that at the moment, there is no ETL process that converts the parsed resumes to dashboard visualisations.
